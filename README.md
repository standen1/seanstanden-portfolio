# Sean Standen | Dev
## [seanstanden.dev](https://seanstanden.dev/)

This is the source code for my portfolio website.  The website is linked in the header above.

## Installation

Install my-project with Git Clone or the download button. Once installed, cd into the project and run npm install.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/standen1/seanstanden-portfolio.git
  npm install
```

This project has configuration for VSCode DevContainers. So, if you would rather work in a container environment, I highly recommend you install the appropriate extensions to run DevContainers in VSCode and clone the repo into a DevContainer.  Links on how to do that are listed here:
[VS Code DevContainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).



## Contributing

Because this is a portfolio website for myself, I do not allow contributions from others.  However, if you see something that needs to be fixed, please feel free to send me a message and I will look into it accordingly.  I do encourage anyone who is interested to download the repo and get ideas or inspiration from my code.
